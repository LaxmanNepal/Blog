While I was exploring different ways to do efficient image processing in Android
I realized that a simple two-dimensional for-loop when written in Java vs C++
could have very different performance. For example: I have been comparing
different ways we can do color-space conversion of an image in Android from
[YUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) color-space to [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) and observed the Java version to be `4.62x` slower than a standard C++ native
code integrated with [JNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface).

| Approach | Average | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| Native | 76.4 ms | 4.62 x slower |
| Java | 353 ms | |

_Table: Performance of converting 8MP (3264x2448) `YUV` image to an `ARGB Bitmap` in Android using Pixel 4a._

And I am talking about straight forward two-dimensional for loops here, with pseudocode like
this for both Java and C++:

```c++
for (int y = 0; y < IMAGE_HEIGHT; ++y) {
    for (int x = 0; x < IMAGE_WIDTH; ++x) {
        // convert pixel in (x, y) from (y, u, v) to (a, r, g, b)
        // a here is alpha channel value always set to 1 in this case.
    }
}
```

> And I'd re-assert, for this example the C++ for loop was not making use of any explicit parallelization or [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instruction sets.

In this article, I am going to write about why do we see this kind of performance difference and how we could mitigate it.

## Important Note
For image processing operation in Android **I don't recommend using Java implementation if your application
is performance sensitive**. This includes the fixes I am going to callout in this article. If you are interested in learning about efficient ways to do image processing in Android please read some of my other articles on the topic:

## Why is the Java code slower than C++ code?
> To be honest I am still exploring this deeply and would update this article as I continue to find more.

Let's look at some key differences between Java code running on Android and Native code running on Android.

{:class="styled-table"}
| # | Java on Android | Native on Android |
| -- | -- | -- | 
| Compiler | With Android 8.0, Android adopted Android Runtime (ART) | Native Development Kit (NDK) in Android uses Clang front end with LLVM backend for compiling native code. |
| Features | Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation + JIT compiler running with the runtime continuously optimizing the algorithm.| No JIT compiler |
| Auto Vectorization | Supported | Has `loop-vectorizer` which widens the instructions in the loop, converting scalar code to vector instructions |

> If some of these concepts are not familiar to you, please check the [appendix](#appendix).

I initially thought it's related to the good `auto-vectorization` support in LLVM compilers used currently in NDK. But as Android adopted ART (Android Runtime), it came with support for loop optimization techniques like `SIMDization`, also known as auto vectorization.

One key difference between Android Runtime vs the C++ compiler is, ART also includes a jJst in Time (JIT) compiler with code profiling that continually improves the performance of an Android Application as they run. The JIT compiler complements ART's current ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler and improves runtime performance, saves storage space, and speeds application and system updates.

To verify this I ran 100 iteration of the algorithm but found the convergence to happen to soon yet not matching the performance of the C++ code:

        Android: why is native code so much faster than Java code
        </a>
    </div>
</div>


Some answers in this StackOverflow question offer some interesting insights for potential reasons for the slowdown, like:

-   **Array bound checking:** Java will check every access and confirm if it's within the bounds or
    throw a useful exception. C++ code on the other hand trust the code and fails miserably if your code mess up, but it ends up being faster.
-   **Garbage Collector:** GC can run at any time, and it consumes CPU cycles. On a low-end device in the past
    I have observed the GC to go crazy when we allocate large contiguous memory for Bitmaps. However, I haven't been able to verify it to be the root cause in this case.

> I am not satisfied with the answers, so I'll continue to explore. I also have my own SO question out there with no satisfactory answer so far.

        Android Java for loop uses less CPU and is slower than C++ for loop
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

On digging a bit, I noticed one more thing â€” when running the C++ version had much higher CPU utilization as
compared to the Java counterpart.

<image src="../images/performance/android/java-forloops-poor-cpu-usage.png" style="width: 100%;" /><br>
_Figure: Screenshot of running profiler, the region in the left with lower CPU usage is when the Java
code is running, while the peaks are when C++ code is running._

{:class="styled-table"}
| Approach	| Avg CPU usage |
| -- | -- | 
| Java | ~12% |
| Native | ~70%+ |

_Table: CPU usage when converting 8MP (3264x2448) `YUV` image to an `ARGB Bitmap` in Android using Pixel 4a._

> I am not sure, why the C++ code reports ~70% CPU utilization! But the poor performance and poor CPU usage
> by the Java code isn't optimal, and we should be able to improve it.

## Multi-threaded Java code
One way to improve the performance is to explicitly write multi-threaded code. For an image we can break it down to tiles of a certain size and process them in parallel. 

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../images/post28_image1.gif">
    <br />
    <i>
        figure: Processing the image in 4 tiles in parallel. (Image Source - <a href="https://halide-lang.org/tutorials/tutorial_lesson_05_scheduling_1.html">halide-lang.org</a>)
    </i>
    <br />
    <br />
</div>

In the GIF above, the image is divided into 4 tiles and processed in parallel. We could do something similar with following pseudo-code:

```java
// .. some tuning params
final int THREAD_COUNT = 8;
final int TILES_PER_AXIS = 16;

// ...
int tileWidth = imageWidth / TILES_PER_AXIS;
int tileHeight = imageHeight / TILES_PER_AXIS;
int threadCount = TILES_PER_AXIS * TILES_PER_AXIS;
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_COUNT);
List<Future<Void>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
// Split the image into NUM_THREADS tiles
for (int i = 0; i < threadCount; i++) {
    int startY = i / TILES_PER_AXIS * tileHeight;
    int endY = startY + tileHeight;
    int startX = i / TILES_PER_AXIS * tileWidth;
    int endX = startX + tileWidth;
    Future<Void> future = executor.submit(() -> {
        yuvToArgb(startX, endX, startY, endY, /** rest of image params. */)
        return /* Void */ null;
    });
    futures.add(future);
}

try {
    for (Future<?> future : futures) {
        future.get(); // do anything you need, e.g. isDone(), ...
    }
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
executor.shutdown();
```

And have `yuvToArgb(..)` do the operation in the provided bounds. The task at hand like `YUV` to `RGB` conversion is particularly suited for this kind of multi-threading as we don't need to explicitly handle concurrency issues.

```java
void yuvToArgb(int startX, int endX, int startY, /** rest of image params. */) {
    for (int y = startY; y < endY; ++y) {
        for (int x = startX; x < endX; ++x) {
            // convert pixel in (x, y) from (y, u, v) to (a, r, g, b)
            // a here is alpha channel value always set to 1 in this case.
        }
    }
}
```

</div>

{:class="styled-table"}
| Approach	| Average latency (ms) | Verdict |
| -- | -- | 
| Java (single threaded) | 353 ms | Slowest |
| Java Threads=2, TilesPerAxis=8 | 199.1 ms | 1.7x faster|
| Java Threads=8, TilesPerAxis=16 | 147 ms | 2.4x faster|
| Java Threads=8, TilesPerAxis=32 | 161 ms | 2.19x faster|
| Java Threads=16, TilesPerAxis=16 | 137.5 ms | 2.57 x faster, **fastest among these**|

_Table: Performance of converting 8MP (3264x2448) `YUV` image to an `ARGB Bitmap` in Android using Pixel 4a
using Java code._

### Verdict
 - Multi threaded code improves the performance of image processing algorithms in Android when using Java.
 - The Native code performance for this kind of operation still beats the performance
    - The multi-threaded code still is `1.8x` slower that standard C++ loops.
    - The same operation can be done in `31.5 ms` using `RenderScript` ([reference](https://blog.minhazav.dev/how-to-use-renderscript-to-convert-YUV_420_888-yuv-image-to-bitmap/)) â€” which is 4.3x faster.
    - Hence, **Java code may not be most suited for this kind of operations**.
 - It's still a `TODO` to understand why we cannot achieve same level of performance with Java code for this kind of operation as that of a standard C++ code (no hand tuning).

## Why is the Java code runtime latency slower than that of the native counterpart
To really explain this I have to take you through a series of concept on modern CPUs and some key differences
between Java's JIT compiler and C++ compilers generally used for Android. The knowledge might be helpful when
doing top-notch performance optimizations.
-->

## Appendix
> Reminder of the content is not critical from this article's perspective. Feel free to read!

### SIMD vs SISD
> To explain this we first need to talk about modern CPUs

[SISD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISD) stands for Single Instruction Stream, Single Data Stream.
Typically, a program's code is executed in sequence, i.e. one after another. Let's say we have two arrays say `a` and `b`, and we want to write a program which converts each element in `a` with following operation:

```c++
a[i] = a[i] + b[i];
```

For each index `i` in the arrays. On the other hand, modern CPUs have capabilities and support for 
[SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) which stands for Single Instruction, Multiple Data. Such machines
can exhibit data level parallelism (which is different from concurrency). They can perform the same instruction
on multiple data at once. For the above example the SIMD CPUs could group and execute the operations in one batch as:

```c++
a[0] = a[0] + b[0];
a[1] = a[1] + b[1];
a[2] = a[2] + b[2];
a[3] = a[3] + b[3];
```

> SIMD instruction for + is called `addps` in [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) or `vaddps` in [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions), and they support grouping of 4 elements and 8 elements respectively (integer type).

        <br />
    </div>
</div>

### Vectorization
SIMD supports instructions that can operate on vector data types. In the above example a group of array
elements like `a[0...3]` or `b[4...7]` can be called vectors. Vectorization is the use of vector instructions
to speed up program execution. Vectorization can be done both by programmers by explicitly writing vector
instructions and by a compiler. The latter case is called `Auto Vectorization`.

Auto Vectorization can be done by AOT (Ahead of Time) compilers at compile time or by JIT (Just in Time) compiler at execution time.

<!-- TODO(mebjas): Add Pointer to article on using NEON. -->

### C++ compiler used in Android
In March 2016, with Android NDK, Revision 11 GCC in the NDK (Native Development Kit) was deprecated in
favor of [Clang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang) (see [NDK revision history](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/revision_history.html)).
Clang uses [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) as the backend which itself is a set of compiler.
LLVM is designed for compile-time, link-time, run-time and idle-time optimizations. I would refrain from writing more about LLVM except for the interesting part in scope of this article.


LLVM has a vectorizer called [Loop Vectorizer](https://llvm.org/docs/Vectorizers.html#loop-vectorizer) which widens the instructions in the loop to operate on multiple consecutive iterations. It uses a cost model to 
decide on the optimal vectorization factor and unroll factor.

Also, Clang support different command line flags which the authors can use to decide what kind of optimizations they prefer. You may have seen flags like `-O0 -O1 -O2 -Os -Oz -O3 -O4` when compiling the native code.

 - `-O0` means no optimization.
 - `-O2` means moderate level of optimization which enables most of the optimizations.
 - `-Oz` and `-Os` are like `-O2` but used for code size reduction.
 - `-O3` is like `-O2`, except that it enables optimizations that take longer to perform or that may generate larger code (in an attempt to make the program run faster).

In my case the code was compiled with `-O3` flag.

### Java: Android Runtime & JIT compiler
> On the other hand in case of Java code in Android:

Android Runtime (ART) was adopted in Android 8.0 and amongst other optimizations it included loop
optimizations including SIMDization (also called vectorization). ART also includes a just in time (JIT)
compiler with code profiling that continually improves the performance of an Android Application as
they run. The JIT compiler complements ART's current ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler and improves runtime performance, saves storage space, and speeds application and system updates.
